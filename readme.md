# Home Agent Project

## Background

For killing my free time, I decided to create this fun project. The Idea behind this project is to create a project using HTML,css, and vanilla JS with a minimum library and also without any dependency management stuff like NPM. Thus, I would be able to see my current skill on using those things to create a website. And brings back my old memory when I build my first website 9+ years ago.
